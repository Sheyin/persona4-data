# Persona4-data

This is a site made for personal use - I found it difficult to look up information on my aging iPad while playing due to non-mobile-friendly sites (many large images, small search boxes, ads slowing down loading time, etc.).  So my solution was to make a proxy site of sorts - some of the information is stored locally, some of it is pulled from a wiki.  This allowed me to centralize the information and make some visual/usability improvements.

Of course, it has taken me _much_ longer to work on this site than I have been actually playing the game... but I suppose I'll be ready for the next time I pick it up again!

## Progress
All the links are functional, but some areas still need to be refined.  Lunch data needs to be formatted, some of the school links may not be displaying for the correct dates.  Search is working, but the results are sometimes improperly formatted.
