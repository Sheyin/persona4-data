# Persona4-data

This is a site made for personal use - I found it difficult to look up information on my aging iPad while playing due to non-mobile-friendly sites (many large images, small search boxes, ads slowing down loading time, etc.).  So my solution was to make a proxy site of sorts - some of the information is stored locally, some of it is pulled from a wiki.  This allowed me to centralize the information and make some visual/usability improvements.

Of course, it has taken me _much_ longer to work on this site than I have been actually playing the game... but I suppose I'll be ready for the next time I pick it up again!
