On this guide, we’ll only list the ‘true’ path that happens as part of the true ending to the game - and we’ll keep it as spoiler-free as we can. It's also worth noting that to complete this s-link, you'll need to reach Rank 6 by November 1st.\nAdachi is available on specific days throughout Persona 4 Golden’s in-game calendar, rather than on a predictable weekly schedule. Split into months, this is when Adachi is available:\nMay: Friday 13th, Friday 20th, Monday 23rd, Wednesday 25th, Friday 27th, Monday 30th\nJune: Sunday 5th, Friday 10th, Saturday 11th, Wednesday 15th (night only), Sunday 26th, Tuesday 28th\nJuly: Saturday 2nd, Monday 4th, Tuesday 5th, Tuesday 12th, Thursday 14th, Sunday 24th and Monday 25th\nAugust: Tuesday 23rd, Thursday 25th\nSeptember: Saturday 1st, Monday 19th, Tuesday 20th, Wednesday 21st, Friday 23rd, Saturday 24th, Tuesday 27th, Friday 30th\nOctober: Thursday 6th, Wednesday 12th, Friday 21st, Monday 24th, Wednesday 26th\nNovember: Tuesday 1st\nAs previously stated, Adachi appears in a different place depending on if it’s daytime or nighttime, and what time you can find him is noted on each rank below. \nTo hang out in the daytime, find him at the Junes entrance.\nFor nighttime s-links, meet near the Gas Station at the very bottom of the South Shopping District.",

Fusion solutions from us:\nThis solution comes in two steps: \nFirst, fuse King Frost (Emperor) with Hua Po (Magician) to get a Kusi Mitana (Strength) that can have Bufula, the skill you need.\nNow use Cross Fusion to fuse Ara Mitama (Chariot), Saki Mitama (Priestess), Nigi Mitama (Temperance) and that Kusi Mitama (Priestess) you just made. The resultant Neko-shogun can inherit Bufula from Kusi Mitama. \nBe sure to register this Neko-shogun with Margaret so you can pull it again later - it’ll be useful in a future rank up."
